Netgearizer
=========

Netgearizer is a Client to Configure/Control Prosafe Plus Switches (i.e. GS108Ev2) from Netgear.
While officially only a Windows closed-source application is served with the switch, I am going to script something in python to do the same.
This Client gives you the ability to configure your Switch on Linux or any other Operating System with python support.
It is still work in progress...nevertheless if you need a feature in hurry, drop me a line i'll ry to prioritize :)

Usage
========

Just execute the python script
    # ./netgearizer.py
