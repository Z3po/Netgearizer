Netgearizer
=========

Netgearizer is a Client to Configure/Control Prosafe Plus Switches (i.e. GS108Ev2) from Netgear.
While officially only a Windows closed-source application is served with the switch, I am going to script something in python to do the same.
If you want to contribute some information, feel free to do so. Any help is totally appreciated.
